# Classifiation_Algorithms_Suprvised_Learning

Supervised classification is the technique most often used for the quantitative analysis of remote sensing image data. At its core is the concept of segmenting the spectral domain into regions that can be associated with the ground cover classes of interest to a particular application. In practice those regions may sometimes overlap. A variety of algorithms are available for the task

# Algorithms Implemented :

# LSTM ( Long Short Term Memory) :
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network but is better than traditional recurrent neural networks in terms of memory. Having a good hold over memorizing certain patterns LSTMs perform fairly better. As with every other NN, LSTM can have multiple hidden layers and as it passes through every layer, the relevant information is kept and all the irrelevant information gets discarded in every single cell.
# Random Forest :
The random forest is a classification algorithm consisting of many decision trees. It uses bagging and features randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.
# Naive Bayes :
It is a classification technique based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
